            :wave: @{issue-author}, we use the issue tracker exclusively
            for bug reports and feature requests. However, this issue appears
            to be a support request. **Could you please [repost on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel), using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag**?
            
            
            Here are all the Backpack communication mediums:
            
            - Long questions (_I have done X and Y and it won't do Z wtf_) - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel), using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag; this is recommended for most questions, since other developers can then find the answer on a simple Google search; also, people get points for answering - and who doesn't like StackOverflow points?!
            - Quick help (_How do I do X_) - [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/BackpackForLaravel/Lobby);
            - Bug Reports, Feature Requests - Github Issues (here);
            
            
            Thank you for understanding.
